      User Query: {user_input}

       Given a complex user query, generate the minimal number of essential sub-queries required to retrieve relevant information. Ensure that:

      - Given a complex user query, generate the minimum number of essential sub-queries required to retrieve relevant information. Follow these rules:
      - Ensure at least two sub-queries if the question involves multiple aspects. Avoid returning just one broad query unless it is truly sufficient.
      - Avoid redundancyâ€”group related entities (like multiple locations, companies, or categories) into a single query.
      - Each sub-query must be distinct and cover a different aspect of the main query.
      - If no breakdown is required, return a refined version of the query in the list format.

      - Add subqueries in the list in such a way that first add queries which require data_analysis to the list and then the queries that will need information from the previous queries to answer the later query.

      RESPONSE FORMAT:
        {{
          "subqueries": ["subquery1", "subquery2"]
        }}
      (If no breakdown is required, return the refined user query in the list instead.)
